/**
 * Digests are secure one-way hash functions that take arbitrary-sized
 * data and output a fixed-length hash value.
 *
 * A [Digest] object starts out initialized. The data is
 * processed through it using the [update]
 * methods. At any point [reset] can be called
 * to reset the digest. Once all the data to be updated has been
 * updated, one of the [digest] methods should
 * be called to complete the hash computation.
 *
 * The [digest] method can be called once for a given number
 * of updates. After [digest] has been called, the [Digest]
 * object is reset to its initialized state.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val digest = ...
 *
 * digest.update(toChapter1)
 * val tc1 = digest.copy()
 * val toChapter1Digest = tc1.digest()
 * digest.update(toChapter2)
 * ... etc.
 * ```
