/**
 *
 * This class implements the padding common to MD4, MD5, the SHA family,
 * and RIPEMD-160. This code works as long as the internal block length
 * is a power of 2, which is the case for all these algorithms.

 *
 * Little-endian padding is for MD4, MD5 and
 * RIPEMD-160; the SHA family uses big-endian padding. The
 * MD padding includes an encoding of the input message bit length,
 * which is over 64 bits for some algorithms, 128-bit for others
 * (namely SHA-384 and SHA-512). Note that this implementation
 * handles only message lengths which fit on 64 bits. The first
 * additional byte value is specified; this is normally 0x80,
 * except for Tiger (not Tiger2) which uses 0x01.
 *
 * @param littleEndian   `true` for little-endian padding
 * @param lenlen         the length encoding length, in bytes (must
 * be at least 8)
 * @param fbyte          the first padding byte
